# 🚀 Overview: Features in Version 2.1

Building on everything in Version 2, this release adds three key enhancements to give you more control over your budget and improve the app’s robustness:

- **🆘 Emergency-Expense Reservation**  
  If you know you’ll have additional or emergency spending next month, enter the estimated amount into the new “Any Emergency” field and hit **Confirm**. The AI will automatically adjust your monthly consumption budget to reserve that buffer for you.

- **📆 Dynamic Savings-Timeline Adjustment**  
  Now when you pick your **Start** and **End** years in the piggy-bank progress panel and click **Confirm**, the app will recalculate:
  - the progress bar percentage  
  - **Have saved** amount  
  - **Still need** amount  
  - detailed monthly breakdown in the **Details** section

- **⚠️ Input-Validation & Error-Handling**  
  To prevent timeline mistakes, selecting an **End** year earlier than the **Start** year now triggers a clear popup error:  
  > **Error: Invalid input**  
  > The start year must be earlier than the end year!  
  > Please re-enter.  
  This guards against misconfigured goals and keeps your projections accurate.
