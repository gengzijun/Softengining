To save at least 1000 RMB next month:  
1. Reduce catering expenses by cooking at home 5 days a week instead of eating out.  
2. Limit entertainment spending to 200 RMB by choosing free activities (e.g., parks, home movies).  
3. Postpone non-essential shopping and set a strict budget of 300 RMB for necessities only.  
4. Track daily expenses using an app to identify and cut unnecessary costs."
